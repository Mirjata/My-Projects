If you have `yarn` installed already, you can skip this step.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build-${branch-name}`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
